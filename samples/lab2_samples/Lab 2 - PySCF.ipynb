Therefore, the form of the basis functions is typically chosen using two criteria:\n","1. Represent the possible shapes of the wave functions as efficiently as possible (i.e. with as few basis functions as possible).\n","2. Use a mathematical form that is convenient and computationally efficient to manipulate mathematically.\n","\n","For example, in calculations for periodic systems, plane-waves are typically used as the basis, i.e. $\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})=e^{i\\mathbf{G}_\\mu\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$. While many plane-waves are required to represent the wavefunction, the periodicity of the plane-waves is useful for solids. On top of that, plane-waves are orthogonal and lend themselves to the efficient use of Fourier transforms to construct the Hamiltonian. For isolated (non-periodic) systems, different basis sets are required, as discussed below."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"44d127ba","metadata":{"id":"44d127ba"},"source":["### LCAO and Gaussian-Type Orbitals\n","\n","**For isolated molecular systems**, it is more efficient to use *atomic orbitals* for $\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})$ because they are localized in a small region of space around an atom, which is more conducive to representing the wave functions of an isolated molecule than periodic, delocalized plane-waves. Because $\\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})$ is a linear combination of the basis functions, this method is called the **linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)**.\n","\n","The most popular functions used for constructing atomic orbitals for the LCAO method are 3D Gaussians, which are 3D functions consisting of a spherical harmonic function of the angular coordinates multiplied by a Gaussian function of the radial coordinate:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","g_{\\alpha lm}(\\mathbf{r}) = N_{\\alpha lm} |\\mathbf{r}|^l  Y_{lm}(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\exp\\left(-\\alpha |\\mathbf{r}|^2\\right)\n","\\end{equation}\n","These functions, which are called **Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs)**, look complicated, but they have a few properties that are extremely convenient for performing quantum mechanics calculations:\n","1. Integrals involving GTOs can usually be performed analytically, which is much more efficient and precise than numerical integration. This enables efficient construction of the electronic Hamiltonian matrix, since matrix elements like the kinetic energy $-\\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\chi_\\mu | \\nabla^2 | \\chi_\\nu \\rangle$ and electron-nuclear interaction $-Z_A \\langle \\chi_\\mu | \\,|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_A|^{-1}\\, | \\chi_\\nu \\rangle$ can be computed efficiently.\n","2. GTOs are *localized* in the sense that a GTO decays very quickly as $\\mathbf{r}$ moves away from the GTO's center. This allows them to efficiently represent atomic orbitals and also enables efficient scaling for large calculations, as orbital pairs with negligible overlap can be ignored when constructing some parts of the Hamiltonian.\n","\n","Using these GTOs, the atomic orbitals $\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})$ can be constructed as\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\alpha} d_{\\alpha,n,l} g_{\\alpha lm}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R}_A)\n","\\end{equation}\n","In this case $\\mu$ is a combined index representing the atom index $A$, orbital energy index $n$, and angular momentum numbers $l,m$. $\\mathbf{R}_A$ is the atomic coordinate of atom $A$. $d_{\\alpha,n,l}$ is an index representing the weight (coefficient) for each GTO in constructing $\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})$.\n","\n","### Basis Set Error\n","\n","A finite set of functions $\\{\\chi_\\mu(\\mathbf{r})\\}$ cannot represent the ground-state wave functions perfectly, and the resulting error in the ground-state energy and properties of a molecule is called the **basis set error** or **basis set incompleteness error**. The way to decrease the basis set error is to use more basis functions, which increases the computational cost of a calculation. For GTOs, the basis set size is typically increased by the **split-valence** constructions, in which the valence orbitals are split into multiple pieces to give the wave function more flexibility to change its shape in response to the electronic environment, thereby decreasing basis set error. Because the symbol $\\zeta$ (zeta) historically referred to the exponents of the Gaussians used to construct GTOs, these larger basis sets are called $n$-zeta basis sets. For example, a double-zeta basis set has two basis functions per valence orbital, a triple-zeta basis has three, and so on. When naming basis sets, split-valence sets are typically denoted `dz` for double-zeta, `tz` for triple-zeta, and so on. When high accuracy is required or intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions are involved, the basis set must also be *augmented* with *diffuse* basis functions (i.e. broad basis functions with a small exponent $\\alpha$ in the Gaussian), often indicated by an `aug` or `d` in the basis set name. You will see some examples of basis set names in the exercises below.\n","\n","### Wave Function Methods\n","\n","Quantum chemistry involves a variety of methods, and many of these methods explicitly describe the correlations between electrons. These correlated wave function approaches are typically implemented with single-particle basis sets; however, instead of constructing the wavefunction as a single Slater determinant of occupied orbitals (like in the Hartree-Fock method), they construct the wave function as a weighted sum of Slater determinants containing different orbitals, with the goal of capturing electronic correlations. These more advanced quantum chemistry methods also require basis sets and also suffer from basis set error that is mitigated by increasing the basis set size.\n","\n","**SUMMARY**: For most quantum chemistry (and DFT) calculations on isolated molecules, the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method is used to represent the wave functions. Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) are typically used to construct the atomic orbitals because they can be integrated analytically, leading to efficient code."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"529099d8","metadata":{"id":"529099d8"},"source":["## Level of Theory\n","\n","In quantum chemistry, except in rare cases for very small systems, exactly solving the many-body Schr&ouml;dinger equation is computationally infeasible, and approximate methods must be used. However, these approximations themselves have varying levels of accuracy and computational cost. More accurate methods are typically more computationally expensive, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The specific quantum mechanical method used to study a system is called the **level of theory**. A more accurate (more expensive) method is considered a *higher* level of theory.\n","\n","An example of a low level of theory is semi-local DFT, which refers to DFT performed with semi-local exchange-correlation (XC) functionals like the LDA and GGAs. Another style of DFT, called hybrid DFT, is more expensive because it mixes a fraction of *exact exchange* into the XC functional, based on the exchange terms in the Hartree-Fock equations. This typically improves some properties like molecular bond energies by removing some *self-interaction error*. Self-interaction error occurs when an electron in a system spuriously repels itself in mean-field approximations. Due to its cost and improved accuracy for most systems, hybrid DFT is considered a higher level of theory than semi-local DFT.\n","\n","One high level of theory we will explore here is the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method, and its extension with perturbative triples CCSD(T). This method handles electronic exchange effects exactly (like Hartree-Fock) and solves for the electronic correlations in an approximate but explicit and rigorous way. CCSD(T) is very computationally expensive and scales poorly with the molecular system size and basis set size, but it is typically much more accurate than either semi-local or hybrid DFT, and it is regarded as the \"gold standard\" among practical quantum chemical approximations.\n","\n","**SUMMARY**: The level of theory of a calculation is the specific method used to solve for the properties of interest. A higher level of theory is typically more accurate in the sense that the predicted ground-state energy will be closer to the exact ground state energy than for a lower level of theory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"51fcb02f","metadata":{"id":"51fcb02f"},"source":["## Assessing a Method's Basis Set and Level of Theory Together\n","\n","In the above two sections, we saw that our quantum chemistry calculations can have two sources of error: basis set error and error due to the approximations made by a given level of theory. To decrease the total error of the ground state energy compared to the exact solution of the many-body Schr&ouml;dinger equation, we typically need to increase both the basis set size and level of theory. If we approach the limit of an infinitely large (complete) basis set and use the full configuration interaction (FCI) method (which is the exact solution for a given basis set), we approach the exact solution of the many-electron Schr&ouml;dinger equation and therefore the exact ground-state energy of the system (within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e088d5b6","metadata":{"id":"e088d5b6"},"source":["## Before Getting Started\n","\n","Typically, when we study systems using DFT, we need to relax the ionic positions to obtain the ground state stucture for a given method.
